Now letâ€™s practice creating and running some SQL queries in the SQL editor.

Consider the following table called INSTRUCTOR:

Task 0: Drop the table INSTRUCTOR from the database in case it already exists, so that we start from a clean state.

(Hint: Ignore the undefined error if this table does not already exist in your database)

Task 1: Create the INSTRUCTOR table as defined above. Have the ins_id be the primary key, and ensure the lastname and firstname are not null.

(Hint: ins_id is of type INTEGER, country of type CHAR(2), and rest of the fields VARCHAR)

Task 2A: Insert one row into the INSTRUCTOR table for the the instructor Rav Ahuja.

(Hint: values for the character fields require a singe quotation mark (') before and after each value)

Task 2B: Insert two rows at once in the INSTRUCTOR table for instructors Raul Chong and Hima Vasudevan.

(Hint: list the values for the second row after the first row)

Task 3: Select all rows from the INSTRUCTOR table.

Task 3B: Select the firstname, lastname and country where the city is Toronto

Task 4: Update the row for Rav Ahuja and change his city to Markham.

Task 5: Delete the row for Raul Chong from the table.

Task 5B: Retrieve all rows in the INSTRUCTOR table

Begin solution:

drop table INSTRUCTOR;

create table INSTRUCTOR (
	ins_id integer PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	lastname char(2) NOT NULL,
	firstname varchar(60) NOT NULL,
	city varchar(60) NOT NULL
);

-- need to call line below to see results
SELECT * from INSTRUCTOR;

INSERT into INSTRUCTOR(ins_id,lastname,firstname,City)
values ('1','Ah','Rav','Toronto');

INSERT into INSTRUCTOR (ins_id,lastname,firstname,City)

values ('2','Ch','Raul','Toronto'), ('3','Va','Hima','Quebec');

SELECT * from INSTRUCTOR;

SELECT * from INSTRUCTOR WHERE City = 'Toronto';

UPDATE INSTRUCTOR SET CITY = 'Markham' WHERE lastname = 'Ah';

SELECT * from INSTRUCTOR;

DELETE from INSTRUCTOR WHERE firstname = 'Raul';

SELECT * from INSTRUCTOR;
