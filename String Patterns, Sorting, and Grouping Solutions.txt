Query 1: Retrieve all employees whose address is in Elgin,IL
[Hint: Use the LIKE operator to find similar strings]

SELECT F_Name, L_Name
FROM Employees
WHERE Address LIKE '%Elgin,IL%';

Query 2: Retrieve all employees who were born during the 1970's.
[Hint: Use the LIKE operator to find similar strings]

SELECT F_Name, L_Name
FROM Employees
WHERE B_Date LIKE '%197_%';

Query 3: Retrieve all employees in department 5 whose salary is between
60000 and 70000 .
[Hint: Use the keyword BETWEEN for this query ]

SELECT F_Name, L_Name
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary BETWEEN 60000 AND 70000
AND Dep_ID = '5';

Query 4A: Retrieve a list of employees ordered by department ID.
[Hint: Use the ORDER BY clause for this query]

SELECT F_Name, L_Name
FROM Employees
ORDER BY Dep_ID;

Query 4B: Retrieve a list of employees ordered in descending order by
department ID and within each department ordered alphabetically in
descending order by last name.

SELECT F_Name, L_Name
FROM Employees
ORDER BY Dep_ID, L_Name DESC;

Query 5A: For each department ID retrieve the number of employees in the
department.
[Hint: Use COUNT(*) to retrieve the total count of a column, and then GROUP BY]

SELECT Dep_ID,
COUNT(*)
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Dep_ID

Query 5B: For each department retrieve the number of employees in the
department, and the average employees salary in the department.
[Hint: Use COUNT(*) to retrieve the total count of a column, and AVG() function to
compute average salaries, and then group]

SELECT Dep_ID,
AVG(Salary),
COUNT(*)
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Dep_ID;

Query 5C: Label the computed columns in the result set of Query 5B as
“NUM_EMPLOYEES” and “AVG_SALARY”.
[Hint: Use AS “LABEL_NAME” after the column name]

SELECT Dep_ID,
AVG(Salary)
AS Avg_Salary,
COUNT(*)
AS COUNT FROM Employees
AS Num_Employees
GROUP BY Dep_ID;

Query 5D: In Query 5C order the result set by Average Salary.
[Hint: Use ORDER BY after the GROUP BY]

SELECT Dep_ID,
AVG(Salary)
AS Avg_Salary,
COUNT(*)
AS COUNT FROM Employees
AS Num_Employees
GROUP BY Dep_ID
ORDER BY Avg_Salary;

Query 5E: In Query 5D limit the result to departments with fewer than 4
employees.
[Hint: Use HAVING after the GROUP BY, and use the count() function in the
HAVING clause instead of the column label.
Note: WHERE clause is used for filtering the entire result set whereas the HAVING
clause is used for filtering the result of the grouping]

SELECT Dep_ID,
AVG(Salary)
AS Avg_Salary,
COUNT(*)
AS COUNT FROM Employees
AS Num_Employees
GROUP BY Dep_ID
HAVING COUNT < 4;
